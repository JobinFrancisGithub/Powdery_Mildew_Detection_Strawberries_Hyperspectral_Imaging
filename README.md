This repository accompanies the paper “Non-Invasive Detection and Characterization of Powdery Mildew in Strawberries Using Hyperspectral Imaging and Deep Learning under Poly-tunnel Conditions”, presented at Computer Graphics &amp; Visual Computing (CGVC) 2025.
Our work demonstrates the use of Hyperspectral Imaging (350–1000 nm) combined with advanced preprocessing (SGS, SNV, MSC) and Isolation Forest outlier removal to detect Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera aphanis) in strawberry leaves grown under realistic poly-tunnel conditions. A 1D-CNN classifier achieved the best performance (75% accuracy, 84% precision) and outperformed traditional methods such as RF, DT, and PLS-DA. The results highlight the potential for scalable, non-destructive, real-time disease monitoring in precision agriculture.
